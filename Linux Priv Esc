Persisentence
  Methods of Persistence
    adding/hijacking a user account
    implementing boot process persistence
    adding or modyifying a cron job
    implementing boot process persistence
    adding a kernel module (with a backdoor)
    SSH Keys
    additional methods outside the scope of the SG

Privilege Escalation
  Sudo
    Sudo -l 
      Lists sudo privileges for the user
      /etc/sudoers
      sudo apt-get changelog apt
      /usr/local/bin/cleanup

  Id 
    Shows priv for user

  Improperly configured cron jobs
    cron jobs can be set up to open/run applications or commands as root
    https://crontab.guru/
    /var/spool

  Vulnerable Services and Kernel Exploits
    similiar to cron jobs
    wall hacks
    check systemd for services
    unpatched Kernel Vulnerabilities
    echo $PATH

Find SGID and SUID Users      
  find / -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null # Find SUID only files
  find / -type f -perm /2000 -ls 2>/dev/null # Find SGID only files
  find / -type f -perm /6000 -ls 2>/dev/null # Find SUID and/or SGID files
    You can then use certain /usr/bin executions to execute other files with root permissions

  System Usage 

  NIX-ism
    unset HISTFILE
    SYSTEMV,upstart,SYSTEMD

  Ways to find out Init Type
    ls -latr /proc/1/exe
    stat /sbin/init
    man init
    init --version
    ps 1

  Auditing SystemV
    ausearch (pulls from audit.log)
  SystemD
    uses journalctl

  Logs for Covering Tracks
    auth.log/secure (logins/authentications
    lastlog ( last successful login time)
    btmp (bad login attempts)
    sulog (usage of SU command )
    utmp (currently logged in users)
    wtmp ( permanent record of user on/off)
